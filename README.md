# CLI Assistant Bot

This is an assistant bot that helps you to manage your address book.

It is a command line application, which can greet you, add new contacts to your address book, change existing ones, 
show phones and birthdays of the given people or the whole phonebook. It also counts the days left to the birthdays of
your meaningful ones. The bot supports searching through contacts by name or by phone number.

For the user not to lose any important information, before exiting, the bot saves the address book into a JSON file. 
On the next run it restores the contacts from the file.
